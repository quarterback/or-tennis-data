# Oregon Team Tennis Championship Proposal

**Presented by Ron Bronson, Catlin Gabel Girls Tennis Head Coach, OACA Tennis Co-Chair**

## What We're Proposing

Add a dual-match team championship to Oregon high school tennis, joining 27 other states that already have one. Teams compete head-to-head (first to 5 points) in single-elimination brackets. The individual singles & doubles tournament continues unchanged. First rounds at home sites; finals at state site.

---

## Format

Based on OSAA Championship Thresholds Task Force guidelines, proposed bracket sizes:

| Classification | Bracket Size | Auto-Bids | At-Large | Within OSAA Threshold |
|----------------|--------------|-----------|----------|----------------------|
| **6A** | 16 teams | 7 league champions | 9 | Yes (max 21 = 45%) |
| **5A** | 16 teams | 4 league champions | 12 | Yes (max 16 = 44%) |
| **4A-1A** | 16 teams | 5 district champions | 11 | Yes (see note) |

*Note: 4A-1A tennis is a combined classification. Individual sport thresholds allow 16-18 teams at 4A/3A levels.*

## Player Participation: The Real Numbers

**Status quo (Individual Tournament Only):**

Each team carries ~12 varsity players, but only a fraction ever compete at state:

| Classification | Total Players | Individual State Draw | Current Rate |
|----------------|---------------|----------------------|--------------|
| 6A | ~564 (47 × 12) | 84 (28 singles + 28 doubles teams) | **15%** |
| 5A | ~360 (30 × 12) | 48 (16 singles + 16 doubles teams) | **13%** |
| 4A-1A | ~576 (48 × 12) | 60 (20 singles + 20 doubles teams) | **10%** |

*Per gender. Each doubles team = 2 players. State qualifiers often come from the same few schools.*

**With Team Championship Added:**

| Classification | Team Tournament | Individual (unchanged) | New Rate |
|----------------|-----------------|------------------------|----------|
| 6A | 192 (16 teams × 12) | 84 | **~45%+** |
| 5A | 192 (16 teams × 12) | 48 | **~60%+** |
| 4A-1A | 192 (16 teams × 12) | 60 | **~40%+** |

*Some overlap between team qualifiers and individual qualifiers, but participation roughly triples.*

**The team tournament doesn't replace anything—it ADDS state-level competition for entire rosters.** A 12-player roster where only 2-3 reached state individually now ALL get to compete for a team championship.

---

## Roster Viability

**Minimum roster to win a dual match: 7 players** (3 singles + 2 doubles)

Analysis of 2025 teams shows nearly all programs can field competitive rosters:

| Classification | Boys | Girls |
|----------------|------|-------|
| 6A | 47 of 47 (100%) | 48 of 48 (100%) |
| 5A | 30 of 30 (100%) | 30 of 30 (100%) |
| 4A-1A | 45 of 46 (98%) | 48 of 50 (96%) |

## 4A-1A Regional First-Round Matching

The 4A/3A/2A/1A classification spans the entire state—Baker City to Brookings, Nyssa to Astoria. Strict seeding creates unreasonable travel burdens:

**Worst-case strict seeding matchups from our analysis:**
- Baker vs North Bend: 331 miles
- St Mary's (Medford) vs Four Rivers (Ontario): 320 miles
- Philomath vs Ontario: 319 miles

**The solution: Regional first-round matching**

- Seeds 1-8 host; Seeds 9-16 travel
- Match visitors to nearest available host (no same-league matchups)
- Seeds 9-16 are statistically interchangeable—only 11% reach quarterfinals regardless of opponent

**Impact:** Analysis of 8 tournaments shows **44.8% travel reduction** (5,162 miles saved). Best single tournament: 73% savings.

**Why only 4A-1A?** 6A and 5A schools are geographically concentrated. The 300-mile first-round trips don't happen. Regional matching solves a 4A-1A problem with a 4A-1A solution.

---

## Weather & Facilities

**No indoor courts required.** Like baseball and softball, reschedule for weather. Regional matching actually helps—nearby teams share similar weather patterns and have shorter reschedule trips.

---

## Consolation Rounds

Wrestling and golf don't have consolation brackets. Exchange tennis consolation rounds for team semifinals/finals at state site:

- Charge admission for team matches (keep individuals free)
- Expanded format that pays for itself
- Trophies awarded to semifinalists, runner-up, and champion (like football)

---

## Power Rankings

OSAA's existing volleyball tournament power ranking handles set-based competition. Tennis team tournament could utilize this infrastructure with minor modifications for tennis scoring to determine at-large bids.

## The Current System Doesn't Identify the Best Teams

Analysis of 4 years of OSAA data (2022-2025) reveals a fundamental disconnect between dual match performance and state tournament results. The individual format rewards 1-2 elite players while ignoring team depth.

**Teams with LOSING dual records placing top 8 at state:**

| Year | Team | Dual Record | State Finish |
|------|------|-------------|--------------|
| 2024 | Vale (4A Boys) | **0-15-0** | 5th place |
| 2024 | Sisters (4A Boys) | **0-8-2** | 5th place |
| 2024 | Southridge (6A Boys) | **5-10-0** | 6th place |
| 2023 | Caldera (5A Boys) | **0-14-3** | 7th place |
| 2023 | Milwaukie (5A Boys) | **0-6-1** | 4th place |
| 2022 | Vale (4A Boys) | **1-11-0** | 6th place |

**Undefeated/dominant teams NOT in state top 8:**

| Year | Team | Dual Record | PI Rank | State Finish |
|------|------|-------------|---------|--------------|
| 2024 | South Eugene (6A Boys) | **16-0-1** | #1 | Not top 8 |
| 2022 | Summit (5A Boys) | **14-0-0** | #1 | Not top 8 |
| 2022 | Silverton (5A Girls) | **11-0-1** | #1 | Not top 8 |
| 2023 | Grant (6A Girls) | **13-0-1** | #5 | Not top 8 |

**What this means:** A team can go winless in dual matches all season, but if they have one elite singles player, they "place" at state. Meanwhile, a team that dominates every dual match 7-0 may not appear in state results at all because their depth doesn't translate to individual tournament brackets.

**The team championship fixes this.** It identifies and rewards the programs that field the best *teams*—not just the schools lucky enough to have one exceptional individual.

## Summary

| Metric | Status Quo | With Team Championship |
|--------|------------|------------------------|
| Team state tournament | None | 16-team brackets (all classes) |
| **6A at state (per gender)** | 84 players (15%) | ~250+ players (45%+) |
| **5A at state (per gender)** | 48 players (13%) | ~220+ players (60%+) |
| **4A-1A at state (per gender)** | 60 players (10%) | ~230+ players (40%+) |
| 4A-1A first-round travel | 300+ mile trips | 44.8% reduction via regional matching |
| Revenue model | Free event | Team matches generate gate |

**Bottom line:** The team tournament triples state-level participation without changing the individual tournament at all.
