# Oregon Team Tennis Championship Proposal

**Presented by Ron Bronson, Catlin Gabel Girls Tennis Head Coach, OACA Tennis Co-Chair**

---

## What We're Proposing

Add a dual-match team championship to Oregon high school tennis, joining 27 other states that already have one. Teams compete head-to-head (first to 5 points) in single-elimination brackets. The individual singles & doubles tournament continues unchanged. First rounds at home sites; finals at state site.

---

## Format

Based on OSAA Championship Thresholds Task Force guidelines, proposed bracket sizes:

| Classification | Bracket Size | Auto-Bids | At-Large | Within OSAA Threshold |
|----------------|--------------|-----------|----------|----------------------|
| **6A** | 16 teams | 7 league champions | 9 | Yes (max 21 = 45%) |
| **5A** | 16 teams | 4 league champions | 12 | Yes (max 16 = 44%) |
| **4A-1A** | 16 teams | 5 district champions | 11 | Yes (see note) |

*Note: 4A-1A tennis is a combined classification. Individual sport thresholds allow 16-18 teams at 4A/3A levels.*

---

## Player Participation: The Real Numbers

**Status quo (Individual Tournament Only):**

Each team carries ~12 varsity players, but only a fraction ever compete at state:

| Classification | Total Players | Individual State Draw | Current Rate |
|----------------|---------------|----------------------|--------------|
| 6A | ~564 (47 × 12) | 84 (28 singles + 28 doubles teams) | **15%** |
| 5A | ~360 (30 × 12) | 48 (16 singles + 16 doubles teams) | **13%** |
| 4A-1A | ~576 (48 × 12) | 60 (20 singles + 20 doubles teams) | **10%** |

*Per gender. Each doubles team = 2 players. State qualifiers often come from the same few schools.*

**With Team Championship Added:**

| Classification | Team Tournament | Individual (unchanged) | New Rate |
|----------------|-----------------|------------------------|----------|
| 6A | 192 (16 teams × 12) | 84 | **~45%+** |
| 5A | 192 (16 teams × 12) | 48 | **~60%+** |
| 4A-1A | 192 (16 teams × 12) | 60 | **~40%+** |

*Some overlap between team qualifiers and individual qualifiers, but participation roughly triples.*

**The team tournament doesn't replace anything—it ADDS state-level competition for entire rosters.** A 12-player roster where only 2-3 reached state individually now ALL get to compete for a team championship.

---

## Roster Viability

**Minimum roster to win a dual match: 7 players** (3 singles + 2 doubles)

Analysis of 2025 teams shows nearly all programs can field competitive rosters:

| Classification | Boys | Girls |
|----------------|------|-------|
| 6A | 47 of 47 (100%) | 48 of 48 (100%) |
| 5A | 30 of 30 (100%) | 30 of 30 (100%) |
| 4A-1A | 45 of 46 (98%) | 48 of 50 (96%) |

---

## 4A-1A Regional First-Round Matching

The 4A/3A/2A/1A classification spans the entire state—Baker City to Brookings, Nyssa to Astoria. Strict seeding creates unreasonable travel burdens:

**Worst-case strict seeding matchups from our analysis:**
- Baker vs North Bend: 331 miles
- St Mary's (Medford) vs Four Rivers (Ontario): 320 miles
- Philomath vs Ontario: 319 miles

**The solution: Regional first-round matching**

- Seeds 1-8 host; Seeds 9-16 travel
- Match visitors to nearest available host (no same-league matchups)
- Seeds 9-16 are statistically interchangeable—only 11% reach quarterfinals regardless of opponent

**Impact:** Analysis of 8 tournaments shows **44.8% travel reduction** (5,162 miles saved). Best single tournament: 73% savings.

**Why only 4A-1A?** 6A and 5A schools are geographically concentrated. The 300-mile first-round trips don't happen. Regional matching solves a 4A-1A problem with a 4A-1A solution.

---

## Weather & Facilities

**No indoor courts required.** Like baseball and softball, reschedule for weather. Regional matching actually helps—nearby teams share similar weather patterns and have shorter reschedule trips.

---

## Consolation Rounds

Wrestling and golf don't have consolation brackets. Exchange tennis consolation rounds for team semifinals/finals at state site:

- Charge admission for team matches (keep individuals free)
- Expanded format that pays for itself
- Trophies awarded to semifinalists, runner-up, and champion (like football)

---

## Power Rankings

At-large bids would be determined using a **tennis-focused power rating system** that builds on OSAA's existing Adjusted Performance Rating (APR) infrastructure:

**Power Index = (APR × 0.50) + (FWS × 0.50)**

- **APR (Adjusted Performance Rating)**: OSAA's existing playoff rating system already used across sports
- **FWS (Flight-Weighted Score)**: Tennis-specific innovation that weights flight positions by competitive significance

**Why FWS matters for tennis:**

In tennis, all wins aren't created equal. FWS prevents teams from "stacking" their top positions by rewarding roster depth across all flights:
- #1 Singles/Doubles: 1.0 weight
- #2 Singles: 0.75, #2 Doubles: 0.50  
- #3 positions: 0.25 each
- #4 positions: 0.10 each

This creates an innovative statewide measurement that combines match outcomes (APR) with roster depth (FWS), ensuring teams can't game the system by concentrating talent while ignoring player development at lower positions.

---

## The Current System Doesn't Identify the Best Teams

Analysis of 4 years of OSAA data (2022-2025) reveals a fundamental disconnect between dual match performance and state tournament results. The individual format rewards 1-2 elite players while ignoring team depth.

### Summary: The Numbers

| Metric | 2022-2025 Total |
|--------|-----------------|
| Teams with losing records placing top 8 at state | **32** |
| Top-8 PI teams shut out of state top 8 | **71** |
| #1 PI-ranked teams NOT in state top 8 | **6** |

**What this proves:** The current individual tournament does not identify the best *teams*. A school can go 0-15 in dual matches and still "place" at state if they have one elite singles player. Meanwhile, undefeated programs (16-0-1, 14-0-0, 11-0-0) are completely invisible in state results.

**The team championship fixes this.** It rewards the programs that build depth, develop all their players, and win matches as a team—not just the schools lucky enough to have one exceptional individual.

---

## Summary

| Metric | Status Quo | With Team Championship |
|--------|------------|------------------------|
| Team state tournament | None | 16-team brackets (all classes) |
| **6A at state (per gender)** | 84 players (15%) | ~250+ players (45%+) |
| **5A at state (per gender)** | 48 players (13%) | ~220+ players (60%+) |
| **4A-1A at state (per gender)** | 60 players (10%) | ~230+ players (40%+) |
| 4A-1A first-round travel | 300+ mile trips | 44.8% reduction via regional matching |
| Revenue model | Free event | Team matches generate gate |

**Bottom line:** The team tournament triples state-level participation without changing the individual tournament at all.
