# Oregon Team Tennis Championship Proposal

## What We're Proposing

Add a dual-match team championship to Oregon high school tennis, joining 27 other states that already have one. Teams compete head-to-head (first to 5 points) in single-elimination brackets. The individual singles & doubles tournament continues unchanged. First rounds at home sites; finals at state site.

## Format

| Classification | Bracket Size | Auto-Bids | At-Large | Teams Qualifying |
|----------------|--------------|-----------|----------|------------------|
| **6A** | 16 teams | 7 league champions | 9 | 34% of teams |
| **5A** | 12 teams | 4 league champions | 8 | 40% of teams |
| **4A/3A/2A/1A** | 12 teams | 5 district champions | 7 | 25% of teams |

**Qualification rates by gender (2025 data):**
- 6A Boys: 16 of 47 teams (34.0%)
- 6A Girls: 16 of 48 teams (33.3%)
- 5A Boys: 12 of 30 teams (40.0%)
- 5A Girls: 12 of 30 teams (40.0%)
- 4A-1A Boys: 12 of 46 teams (26.1%)
- 4A-1A Girls: 12 of 50 teams (24.0%)

## Roster Viability

**Minimum roster to win a match: 7 players**

Analysis of 2025 teams shows nearly all programs field competitive rosters:

| Classification | Boys | Girls |
|----------------|------|-------|
| 6A | 47 of 47 (100%) | 48 of 48 (100%) |
| 5A | 30 of 30 (100%) | 30 of 30 (100%) |
| 4A-1A | 45 of 46 (98%) | 48 of 50 (96%) |

## Expanded Access: Two Paths to State

The dual format creates **more opportunities**, not fewer:

1. **Team Tournament Path**: Top players from qualifying teams compete together
2. **Individual Tournament Path**: Top singles/doubles players qualify regardless of team strength

**A player whose team doesn't make the team bracket can still qualify for state individually.** This is more access than the current format, not less. In no other sport can you win a "team" state title with fewer than half a roster—tennis would now reward both individual excellence AND team depth.

## 4A-1A Regional First-Round Matching

The 4A/3A/2A/1A classification spans the entire state—Baker City to Brookings, Nyssa to Astoria. Strict seeding creates unreasonable travel burdens:

**Worst-case strict seeding matchups from our analysis:**
- Baker vs North Bend: 331 miles
- St Mary's (Medford) vs Four Rivers (Ontario): 320 miles
- Philomath vs Ontario: 319 miles

**The solution: Regional first-round matching**

- Seeds 1-8 host; Seeds 9-16 travel
- Match visitors to nearest available host (no same-league matchups)
- Seeds 9-16 are statistically interchangeable—only 11% reach quarterfinals regardless of opponent

**Impact:** Analysis of 8 tournaments shows **44.8% travel reduction** (5,162 miles saved). Best single tournament: 73% savings.

**Why only 4A-1A?** 6A and 5A schools are geographically concentrated. The 300-mile first-round trips don't happen. Regional matching solves a 4A-1A problem with a 4A-1A solution.

## Weather & Facilities

**No indoor courts required.** Like baseball and softball, reschedule for weather. Regional matching actually helps—nearby teams share similar weather patterns and have shorter reschedule trips.

---

## Consolation Rounds

Wrestling and golf don't have consolation brackets. Exchange tennis consolation rounds for team semifinals/finals at state site:

- Charge admission for team matches (keep individuals free)
- Expanded format that pays for itself
- Trophies awarded to semifinalists, runner-up, and champion (like football)

## Power Rankings

OSAA's existing volleyball tournament power ranking handles set-based competition. Tennis team tournament could utilize this infrastructure with minor modifications for tennis scoring to determine at-large bids.
